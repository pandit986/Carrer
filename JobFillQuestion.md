# Why should be hired you
I have strong hands-on experience in React and React Native, demonstrated by my work at Fyntune Solutions, where I helped develop a platform serving over 100K daily users. My proficiency in modern JavaScript frameworks enables me to deliver scalable and efficient solutions quickly, making me an excellent fit for your team.


I have  2 years of hands-on experience with React.js, and about 80% of my work time is dedicated to developing React.js applications, while the rest is spent on debugging and integrating with other technologies. For example, at my current company, I single-handedly built key features for an employee benefits platform that now serves over 100,000 daily users. I developed custom dashboards, real-time notifications, and claim processing systems that significantly improved the overall user experience. Additionally, I extended the platform’s functionality to mobile by creating companion apps with React Native. In my previous role, I worked on a pregnancy management web application where I built a personalized dashboard for appointment scheduling and health tracking, streamlining processes for users. This hands-on experience in React.js has allowed me to deliver efficient, user-friendly solutions that make a real difference.
